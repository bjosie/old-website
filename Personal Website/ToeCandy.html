                            <p>ToeCandy is a MIDI-Control surface ready for 3-dimensions of control.......what?</p>
                            <p>Okay. ToeCandy is a MIDI controller I designed to work as a digital DAW pedal. Let's say you want a very specific pedal sound, and you can only get that through a plug-in. Then, mid-solo, you want to sweep through one of the plug-in's knobs...or two......or three!</p>
                            <p>This project was designed to be a solution to needing more control while your hands are full. Just hook this up to your computer via a micro-usb cable and map it to anything you like inside of ProTools, Logic, Ableton or any software you use!</p>
                            <p>Under the hood, I was able to design a circuit using Autodesk's EAGLE, then carve it out on an Othermill. There are two force sensors under each pad measuring the X-direction from both your toe and yout heel. This parameter is great for things like pitch wobble. For the surface under your feet, I 3D-printed two molds, into which I poured a silicone concoction. The surface has a great, fun, ~squishy~ feel to it! To help the user see their output, I enlisted some of Adafruit's Dotstar LEDs. A meter helps the user visualize what the device is sending to their DAW and adjust accordingly. The entire housing was built out of acrylic and held together with acrylic cement.</p>
                            <p>What really got me excited was the idea of using this for more than just music. Designing a video game? Create visual art on your computer? Anything where your feet are feeling left out of the project could maybe use a ToeCandy. If you have any fun ideas for this, please let me know!</p>
